* configure the query string with correct key value pairs

#### Documentation

#### Providers & Assignments
- Aaron & Khoa - Linkedin
- Anna & Phillip - Yahoo!
- Ariel & Tyler - Evernote
- Autumn & Max - Github
- Brittany & Tama - Facebook
- Haley & Richard - Dropbox
- Josh & James - Auth0
- Madhu & Mike - Instagram

Note that each of these will follow the same general handshaking format as Google, so the steps will be largely the same, but with different credentials.  You should be able to create free accounts with each provider for the purposes of making this connection.
